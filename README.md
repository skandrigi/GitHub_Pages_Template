# Lung and Colon Cancer Classification

*Implemented machine learning algorithms to differentiate between cancerous and benign lung cells, enhancing early diagnosis of lung cancer. Leveraged skills in ML, data analysis, and computational biology within AI4ALL's program, showcasing AI's impactful role in healthcare.*


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

*The motivation behind the project of using machine learning and tools to distinguish between cancerous and benign cells in human lungs stems from the urgent need to improve early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer. Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a high mortality rate often attributed to late-stage diagnoses.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
